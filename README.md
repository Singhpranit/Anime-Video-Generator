# Anime-Video-Generator
Pose guided Anime Video Generator using Deep Learning. Its a self project created being inspired by StyleGAN2, PSGAN and Unsupervised Image-to-Image translation.

## Idea and Goal

The Idea behind this project is to generate Anime video (Target Video) from corresponding real time human video (Source Video). 
The Idea is split into three parts - 
  1. Split video into Frames
  2. Extract the pose from each frame.
  3. Generate the Anime character corresponding to each pose.
